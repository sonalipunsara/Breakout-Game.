The provided code is an implementation of the breakout game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks on the screen by bouncing the ball off 
the paddle and hitting the bricks.

HTML Structure:

The HTML file contains a canvas element with an id "gameCanvas" for rendering the game graphics.
It also includes a heading element with id "Title" and a paragraph element with id "scoreDisplay" 
for displaying the game title and score.

CSS Styling:

The CSS file ("style.css") is linked to the HTML file to provide styling to the game elements.
The game canvas is given a border, background color, and positioned on the page.
The title and score display elements are styled with text alignment and color.

Game Variables:

The JavaScript code starts by declaring variables to store various game-related information such as canvas, 
context, ball properties, paddle properties, brick properties, score, level, lives, etc.
These variables are initialized with appropriate values.

Event Listeners:

Event listeners are added to the document to track the keyboard input for paddle movement.
When a key is pressed down or released, the corresponding flag variables (rightPressed and leftPressed) are 
set accordingly.

Functions:

The code defines several functions to handle different aspects of the game.

1.createBricks() function is responsible for creating the bricks for the current level by populating the bricks array.
2.keyDownHandler() and keyUpHandler() functions handle the keyboard input for paddle movement.
3.collisionDetection() function checks for collisions between the ball and bricks.
4.Drawing functions (drawBall(), drawPaddle(), drawBricks(), drawScore(), drawLevel(), drawLives()) are used to 
  draw different elements of the game on the canvas.
5.draw() function is the main game loop that clears the canvas, updates the game state, and redraws the game elements.
6.resetBallAndPaddle() function resets the ball and paddle positions after losing a life or moving to the next level.
7.saveScore() function saves the player's score as the highest score in the local storage if it's higher than the previously
  saved score. 

Game Initialization:

1.The createBricks() function is called to initialize the bricks for the first level.
2.The draw() function is called to start the game loop and render the game elements on the canvas.

Displaying High Score:

The code retrieves the highest score from the browser's local storage using localStorage.getItem().
If a highest score exists, it is displayed on the page using the scoreDisplay element.

Downloading score:

After the game is over (all lives are lost), the player's score is saved as a text file using the saveScore() function.
